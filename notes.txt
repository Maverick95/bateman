For each clothing category, there is an order to each to say how to construct in the sentence,

A hierarchy that, at the lowest level, within each category, you can pick ONLY ONE of the elements.
For example, within CHEST below, you can't wear a suit and a blazer, because these are both OUTER COAT components.

Everything is CHOSEN, but whether or not it is included in the description is OPTIONAL.

Therefore everything has a probability both of being CHOSEN and of being DESCRIBED
Being DESCRIBED is optional always.

Next step is probably to dicern which categories are actually included.

Actually remember for now you're just building up the categories.

Next I think is adding the brands in.

Brands are included within the lower levels, so you'll have to trawl through the notes again.
