For each clothing category, there is an order to each to say how to construct in the sentence,

A hierarchy that, at the lowest level, within each category, you can pick ONLY ONE of the elements.
For example, within CHEST below, you can't wear a suit and a blazer, because these are both OUTER COAT components.

Everything is CHOSEN, but whether or not it is included in the description is OPTIONAL.

Therefore everything has a probability both of being CHOSEN and of being DESCRIBED
Being DESCRIBED is optional always.

Next step is probably to dicern which categories are actually included.

Actually remember for now you're just building up the categories.

Next I think is adding the brands in.

Brands are included within the lower levels, so you'll have to trawl through the notes again.

Next step is to choose a random brand from each.

This is fine and we have success.

Additionally these choices need grouping into some final string.

We need to abstract out the production of the actual final result.

In the interim, each clothing item needs transforming into a particular interim object type.

Now we need the order from each category.

This may be subjective, need a definitive list.

eyewear
wristwear
on_chest
over_chest_1
neckwear
over_chest_2
in_the_pocket
outer_coat
legwear
waistwear
anklewear
footwear

I'd go with...

1   outer_coat
2   over_chest_2 (suit etc.)
3   on_chest (shirt etc.)
4   over_chest_1
5   neckwear
6   in_the_pocket
7   wristwear
8   legwear
9   waistwear
10  anklewear
11  footwear
12  eyewear (always at end)
