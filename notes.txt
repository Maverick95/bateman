So this may be rambling at first but hopefully I'll identify something.

The first thing is to identify the base STRUCTURE of the person's outfit.

What are the separate components? Are these required / optional?

Suit
Blazer
Sport coat
Tuxedo
Jacket
Shirt
Tie
Coat
Dinner jacket
Trousers
Wing tips (type of shoe)
Lace-ups (type of shoe)
Just shoes
Loafers
Pumps
Eyeglasses
Watch
T-shirt
Slip-ons
Belt
A handkerchief in the pocket
Sweater
Corduroys
Moccasins
Slacks
Socks
Pocket square
Waistcoat

So there generally is a property hierarchy here.

At the top you have OUTFIT.

Under this are the individual components, there is an order to each to say how to construct in the sentence,

So you should probably start by just returning the basic components of the outfit, whatever these are.
