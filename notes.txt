So this may be rambling at first but hopefully I'll identify something.

The first thing is to identify the base STRUCTURE of the person's outfit.

What are the separate components? Are these required / optional?

So there generally is a property hierarchy here.

At the top you have OUTFIT.

Under this are the individual components, there is an order to each to say how to construct in the sentence,

So you should probably start by just returning the basic components of the outfit, whatever these are.

But the thing is, these individual components could be possibilities within a certain set.

So the first level below OUTFIT is COMPONENT

But what I'm thinking is, the simplest level is the AREA OF THE BODY that the article relates to.

What you want to achieve is the barest hierarchy that, at the lowest level, within each category, you can pick
ONLY ONE of the elements.

For example, within CHEST below, you can't wear a suit and a blazer, because these are both OUTER COAT components.

Also, suit and tuxedo, it's ambiguous if this relates to the suit/trouser combination, or just the suit.

Waistcoat is only available if shirt is chosen.

For "sweater", you can't wear a waistcost if you're wearing a sweater.

You might find other strange combinations of clothing allocated.

BUT thinking about it now, one of the main things you are missing is SITUATION.

Because this in fact completely dictates the choices of outfit?

Is this a hierarchy above the outfit itself?

Or is a hierarchy the correct way of viewing this?
